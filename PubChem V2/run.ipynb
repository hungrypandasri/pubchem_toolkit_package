    "Pytest offers various features that enhance the testing experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixture Support**: Pytest provides a fixture mechanism for managing test dependencies and resources. Fixtures help set up preconditions for tests and can be reused across multiple test functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parameterization**: Pytest supports test parametrization, allowing you to run the same test with different inputs. This promotes code reuse and reduces the need for duplicate test code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rich Assertion Library**: Pytest comes with a rich set of built-in assertion methods for making test assertions. These assertions are expressive and cover a wide range of scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Plugins**: Pytest has a vast ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality. Plugins can be used for features such as code coverage analysis, test reporting, and mocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Integration**: Pytest integrates well with other tools and frameworks, making it suitable for various testing workflows. It can be seamlessly integrated with continuous integration (CI) systems and other testing tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Pytest offers a flexible and powerful testing framework that simplifies the process of writing and running tests, leading to more robust and maintainable codebases.\n"
